#ðŸŒ¸ScentSense-Predicting-Perfume-Preferences-through-Statistical-Machine-Learning-Insights


## Overview
ScentSales is a data analysis project focused on predicting perfume sales volume based on bottle size and price. We used a dual approach combining **Statistical Analysis** and **Machine Learning** to extract insights and build predictive models. This project helps understand how product features like size and price influence consumer purchasing behavior.

## Objectives
- Explore statistical trends and relationships between bottle size, price, and sales volume.
- Apply hypothesis testing to examine the significance of various factors.
- Build predictive models to estimate sales volume based on key features.
- Compare the results from traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques.


## Tools & Techniques
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - Descriptive & Inferential statistics  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Linear regression  
  - Hypothesis testing & ANOVA and Interval Estimation 

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
